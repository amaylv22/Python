			<h1>Variables & data types</h1>
			<hr>
				<!-- Variables -->
			<h2>Variables</h2>
			<p>A <b>variable</b> is a word/identifier/object that hangs a value. The variables on python are defined dynamically, it means that it not neccesary to specify the type of data that will be store on them</p>
			<p>The symbol "=" is the assignment operator, for example</p>
			<code>
				x = 1<br>
				text = "hola"
			</code>
			
				<!-- data types -->
			<h2>Data types in python</h2>
			<p>Here the main python's data types are described</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Type</th>
					<th>Class</th>
					<th>Notes</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>int</td>
					<td>integer number</td>
					<td>Fixed precision variable, automatically converted to long type in overflow case</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>float</td>
					<td>decimal number</td>
					<td>double precision decimal number</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>bool</td>
					<td>boolean variable</td>
					<td>True or False (case-sensitive)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>string</td>
					<td>string of characters</td>
					<td>a string literal is created writing it down between quotations marks ('_') or ("_")</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h3>Strings special charcters</h3>
			<p>Not any symbol could use written directly in a string, there are several <b>special characters</b> that wait for special care to be included in a string of charcaters.</p>
			<p>Due its nature, this character needs to be marked as unike or <b>escaped</b>. The <b>backslash charcater (\)</b> does this work, just appearing directly before the special charcater, e.g.</p>
			<code>
				var1 = "you\'re the one who..."
			</code>
			
			<!-- MATH OPERATIONS -->
			
			<hr>
			<h1>Math Operations</h1>
			<hr>
			
				<!-- Arithmetic operators -->
			<h2>Arithmetic operator</h2>
			<p>There are six principal arithmetic operator in python, these are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Addition &rarr; (+)</li>
				<li>Subtraction &rarr; (-)</li>
				<li>Multiplication &rarr; (*)</li>
				<li>Division &rarr; (/)</li>
				<li>Exponentiation &rarr; (**)</li>
				<li>Modulo &rarr; (%)</li>
			</ol>
			
						<!-- COMPARATORS -->
			
			<hr>
			<h1>Comparators</h1>
			<hr>
			
			<p>There are six different comparators, each one generates a True or False result once been evaluated:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Equal to (<b>==</b>)</li>
				<li>Not equal to (<b>!=</b>)</li>
				<li>Less than or  (<b><</b>)</li>
				<li>Less than or equal to (<b><=</b>)</li>
				<li>Greater than (<b>></b>)</li>
				<li>Greater than or equal to (<b>>=</b>)</li>
			</ol>
			
						<!-- LOGICAL OPERATORS -->
			
			<hr>
			<h1>Logical operators</h1>
			<hr>
			
			<p>Also known as boolean operators, there are three of them and they are used to obtain True or False results based on the conventional true tables of conjunction (&), disjunction (|) and negation (~).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>And (<b>and</b>)</li>
				<li>Or (<b>or</b>)</li>
				<li>Not  (<b>not</b>)</li>
			</ol>
			
			<!-- order of operation for logic operators -->
			<h2>Order of operation for logic operators</h2>
			<p>The order to evaluate the logical operator is at first <b>not</b>, next <b>and</b>, finally <b>or</b>.</p>
			<p>This order can be changed by including parentheses.</p>
			
						<!-- BITWISE OPERATORS -->
			
			<hr>
			<h1>Bitwise operators</h1>
			<hr>
			
			<p>Bitwise operations are operations that directly manipulate bits. And its syntaxis is:</p>
			<code>
			element_1 <b>operator</b> elemnt_2
			</code>
			<p>for all of them, exept for the <b>not</b> operator that is:</p>
			<code>
			<b>operator</b> element
			</code>
			<p>The six baisc bitwise operators are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Right shift (<b>&gt;&gt;</b>)</dt>
					<dd>This operator work by shifting the bits to the right by a designated number of slots. It is mathematically equivalent to floor dividing by 2, e.g.: <br>
					<code>
					0b0010100 &gt;&gt; 3 = 0b000010 (20 &gt;&gt; 3 = 2) <br>
0b0000010 &gt;&gt; 2 = 0b000000 (2 &gt;&gt; 2 = 0)
					</code>
					</dd>
				<dt>Left shift (<b>&lt;&lt;</b>)</dt>
					<dd>This operator work by shifting the bits to the left by a designated number of slots. It is mathematically equivalent to multiplying by 2, e.g.: <br>
					<code>
					0b000001 &lt;&lt; 2 = 0b000100 (1 &lt;&lt; 2 = 4) <br>
					0b000101 &lt;&lt; 3 = 0b101000 (5 &lt;&lt; 3 = 40)
					</code>
					</dd>
				<dt>Bitwise AND (<b>&</b>)</dt>
					<dd>performs the bit-by-bit conjunction operation, and return the resultant number</dd>
				<dt>Bitwise OR (<b>|</b>)</dt>
					<dd>performs the bit-by-bit disjunction operation, and return the resultant number</dd>
				<dt>Bitwise XOR (<b>^</b>)</dt>
					<dd>performs the exclusive or operation (1 is either of the two incoming bits are 1 but noth both) on a bit level, and returns the result</dd>
				<dt>Bitwise NOT (<b>~</b>)</dt>
					<dd>The bitwise NOT operator just flips all of the bits in a single number.</dd>
			</dl>
			
			<p><b>NOTE:</b> to print a decimal number in its binary representation use the <b>bin()</b> function.</p>
			<p>You can also represent numbers in base 8 and base 16 using the <b>oct()</b> and <b>hex()</b> functions.</p>
			<p>Aditionaly, using the second parameter of the <b>int()</b> function, you can specify the base of the number that you're trying to convert into an integer:</p>
			<code>
			int("1010",2) -> 10
			</code>
			
			<!-- TERMINAL PRINTING -->
			<hr>
			<h1>Terminal Printing</h1>
			<hr>
			
				<!-- Basic printing -->
			<h2>Basic printing</h2>
			<p>In Python the command <b>print</b> is used to show results and the content of variables in the console</p>
			<p>The syntax looks like this:</p>
			<code>
			print "Welcome to python"
			</code>
			<p><b>when</b> the message is a <b>string literal</b>. Or like this:</p>
			<code>
			print var1
			</code>
			<p><b>when</b> the content is saved into a <b>variable</b></p>
			
				<!-- String concatenation -->
			<h2>String concatenation</h2>
			<p>The operator (<b>+</b>) used between two string is used to concatenate them.</p>
			<code>
			print "string 1" + "string 2"<br>
			print var1 + var2
			</code>
			
				<!-- String fromating with % -->
			<h2>String formating with %</h2>
			<p>Another way to work with concatenated strings is using the "substitution operator" (<b>%</b>), that works as a variable inside of a string, e.g.</p>
			<code>
			print "This is a message from %s" % (name_1)
			</code>
			<p>It's posible to have as many variables as ones want, but all of the have to be separated by commas between the parentheses after the symbol <b>%</b>, this is:</p>
			<code>
			print "Today, %s of the %s week of %s, you need to..." % (today, week_cont, month)
			</code>
			<p><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm">Python % code</a></p>
			<p>We can specify the number of floating-point decimals to print by changing "%f" to "%.xf", where x is the number of decimals we want (be sure to note the . between % and x!). </p>
			
						<!-- THE ZEN OF PYTHON -->
			<hr>
			<h1>The Zen of python</h1>
			<hr>
			
			<p>Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
    Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
    Simple is better than complex.<br>
    Complex is better than complicated.<br>
    Flat is better than nested.<br>
    Sparse is better than dense.<br>
    Readability counts.<br>
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
    Although practicality beats purity.<br>
    Errors should never pass silently.<br>
    Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
    Now is better than never.<br>
    Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</p>
